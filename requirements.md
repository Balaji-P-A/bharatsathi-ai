# BharatSathi AI – Requirements Specification

## 1. Overview
BharatSathi AI is a student-track hackathon project aimed at improving access to government schemes and public services for Indian citizens. The system focuses on inclusion, accessibility, and real-world public impact by enabling local-language, voice-first interaction for users with low digital literacy and limited internet connectivity.

## 2. Problem Statement
In India, information about government schemes and public services is fragmented across multiple portals and documents, primarily available in English and complex legal language. Rural, semi-urban, elderly, and first-time applicants often struggle to discover eligible schemes, understand requirements, and complete application processes.

## 3. Goals and Objectives
- Improve awareness of government schemes and public services
- Enable access through local languages and voice interaction
- Simplify eligibility understanding and application steps
- Support low-bandwidth and basic smartphone usage
- Demonstrate meaningful AI usage for social impact

## 4. Target Users
- Rural and semi-urban citizens
- Elderly users with low digital literacy
- First-time applicants of government schemes
- Citizens accessing services via basic smartphones

## 5. Functional Requirements
- The system shall accept user queries via text and voice input
- The system shall support at least one local Indian language
- The system shall provide scheme information using AI-generated responses
- The system shall explain eligibility criteria in simple language
- The system shall provide step-by-step application guidance
- The system shall retrieve information from a predefined set of government scheme documents

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements
- The system shall be optimized for low-bandwidth environments
- The system shall provide responses within acceptable latency for conversational use
- The system shall ensure basic data privacy and security
- The system shall be accessible on mobile devices

## 7. Assumptions and Constraints
- The prototype is limited to one Indian state
- Only a limited number of government schemes are included
- The project is developed as a student-track prototype
- The system does not perform real transactions or submissions

## 8. Out of Scope
- Nationwide deployment
- Integration with live government databases
- User authentication and identity verification
- Financial transactions or direct application submission
